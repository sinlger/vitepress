## Detailed Conversion Formula

**Basic conversion relationship:**
- 1 kilowatt (kW) = 0.9478 British thermal unit per second (Btu/s)
- 1 British thermal unit per second (Btu/s) = 1.055 kilowatts (kW)

**Precise conversion formula:**
- **kW to Btu/s**: Btu/s = kW × 0.9478
- **Btu/s to kW**: kW = Btu/s × 1.055

**Common value reference table:**
| Kilowatts (kW) | British Thermal Units per Second (Btu/s) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 0.9478 |
| 5 | 4.739 |
| 10 | 9.478 |
| 20 | 18.956 |
| 50 | 47.39 |
| 100 | 94.78 |

## Application Examples

### Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Systems
- **Central air conditioning system**: Large commercial air conditioning power can reach 100-500kW, requiring precise Btu/s conversion for equipment selection
- **Cold storage refrigeration equipment**: Industrial cold storage refrigeration power is usually marked in kW, but North American standards require Btu/s values
- **Heat pump systems**: Heat pump heating and cooling capacity conversion between kW and Btu/s standards

### Industrial Heating Applications
- **Heating system power calculation**: European standards use kW, North American standards use Btu/s, requiring accurate conversion for international projects
- **Boiler equipment selection**: Boiler power marking (kW) and steam generation capacity (Btu/s) conversion
- **Industrial heating equipment**: Heating furnaces, heaters, and other equipment power conversion between different standards

### HVAC Engineering Design
- **Ventilation system design**: Fan power (kW) and air heating capacity (Btu/s) conversion calculation
- **Heat exchanger design**: Power calculation and unit unification and conversion in heat exchange equipment

## Usage Recommendations

### Conversion Precision
- **Engineering calculations**: Use precise conversion coefficient 0.9478, retain 4 decimal places
- **Equipment selection**: Consider equipment efficiency, usually 80-95%
- **Temperature conditions**: Btu/s values may be affected by ambient temperature, perform conversion under standard conditions

### Application Standards
- **International projects**: Recommend using international units (kW) as intermediate conversion units
- **Regional standards**: North America uses Btu/s, Europe and Asia use kW
- **Technical documentation**: Recommend providing both kW and Btu/s values simultaneously

### Design Considerations
- **Safety margin**: Equipment selection should consider 15-25% power margin
- **Efficiency factors**: Actual power conversion should consider equipment efficiency
- **Environmental conditions**: Consider the impact of ambient temperature and humidity on equipment performance

## FAQ

**Q: Why is kW to Btu/s conversion needed?**
A: In HVAC and industrial heating fields, equipment mechanical power is often expressed in hp, while thermal load is expressed in Btu/s. Conversion helps with power matching and system design.

**Q: Is the hp to Btu/s conversion accurate?**
A: The conversion coefficient is a precise physical constant, but practical applications need to consider equipment efficiency. Theoretical conversion: 1 hp = 0.7068 Btu/s.

**Q: What are the characteristics of Btu/s as a power unit?**
A: Btu/s is a thermal power unit, mainly used in North American HVAC industry, suitable for describing heating and cooling capacity.

**Q: How to use this conversion in refrigeration equipment?**
A: Refrigeration equipment compressor power (kW) can be converted to refrigeration capacity (Btu/s), but actual refrigeration capacity also depends on refrigerant type and operating conditions.

**Q: What special requirements do industrial heating furnaces have for power conversion?**
A: Industrial heating furnaces need to consider heating efficiency, heat loss, and process requirements. It's recommended to add a 20-30% safety factor based on theoretical conversion.

**Q: What should be noted in international project applications?**
A: International projects should consider different regional standards, recommend using kW as the primary unit and providing Btu/s conversion values, ensuring technical documentation clarity.

**Q: Is conversion through kW intermediate more accurate?**
A: Yes, using kW as intermediate conversion (hp→kW→Btu/s) can reduce cumulative errors and is suitable for high-precision engineering calculations.
