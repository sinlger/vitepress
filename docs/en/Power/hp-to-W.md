# Horsepower (hp) to Watt (W) Conversion

The conversion from horsepower (hp) to watt (W) is a fundamental calculation in automotive engineering and industrial equipment. Horsepower is a traditional power unit widely used in automotive and mechanical industries, while watt is the international standard power unit. This tool provides precise hp to W conversion functionality, supporting bidirectional conversion, suitable for automotive engine power calculation, motor selection, industrial equipment power matching, and other professional application scenarios.

<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const form = ref({
  number: 0,
  to: 'W'
})

const options = [
  { label: 'Horsepower (hp)', value: 'hp' },
  { label: 'Watt (W)', value: 'W' }
]

const rules = {
  number: {
    required: true,
    message: 'Please enter a number',
    trigger: ['blur', 'input']
  }
}

const result = ref('')

const convertHandler = () => {
  if (form.value.to === 'W') {
    result.value = (form.value.number * 745.7).toFixed(4) + ' W'
  } else {
    result.value = (form.value.number / 745.7).toFixed(4) + ' hp'
  }
}

## Detailed Conversion Formula

**Basic conversion relationship:**
- 1 horsepower (hp) = 745.7 watts (W)
- 1 watt (W) = 0.001341 horsepower (hp)

**Precise conversion formula:**
- **hp to W**: W = hp × 745.7
- **W to hp**: hp = W × 0.001341

**Common value reference table:**
| Horsepower (hp) | Watts (W) |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | 745.7 |
| 5 | 3,728.5 |
| 10 | 7,457 |
| 50 | 37,285 |
| 100 | 74,570 |
| 500 | 372,850 |

## Application Examples

### Automotive Engineering
- **Engine power**: Car engines typically range from 100-500hp (74.57-372.85kW), requiring precise W conversion for technical specifications
- **Electric vehicle motors**: Electric vehicle motor power is usually marked in kW, but traditional automotive industry still uses hp for comparison
- **Motorcycle engines**: Motorcycle engine power ranges from 10-200hp, requiring hp to W conversion for international market specifications

### Industrial Equipment
- **Industrial motors**: Industrial motor power is usually marked in kW, but some traditional equipment still uses hp marking
- **Pumps and compressors**: Pump and compressor power conversion between hp and W standards for equipment selection
- **Generator sets**: Generator power marking (hp) and electrical output (W) conversion calculation

### Motor Selection
- **Electric motor power**: Motor nameplate power (hp) and actual power consumption (W) conversion
- **Servo motor applications**: Precision servo motor power calculation and unit conversion
- **Variable frequency drive**: VFD motor power matching and unit unification

## Usage Recommendations

### Conversion Precision
- **Engineering calculations**: Use precise conversion coefficient 745.7, retain 4 decimal places
- **Equipment selection**: Consider motor efficiency, usually 85-95%
- **Load conditions**: Motor actual power varies with load, perform conversion under rated conditions

### Application Standards
- **International projects**: Recommend using international units (W/kW) as primary units
- **Regional standards**: North America commonly uses hp, Europe and Asia use W/kW
- **Technical documentation**: Recommend providing both hp and W values simultaneously

### Design Considerations
- **Safety margin**: Motor selection should consider 15-25% power margin
- **Efficiency factors**: Actual power conversion should consider motor efficiency
- **Operating conditions**: Consider the impact of ambient temperature and load characteristics on motor performance

## FAQ

**Q: Why is hp to W conversion needed?**
A: In automotive and industrial fields, traditional equipment uses hp marking, while modern international standards use W/kW. Conversion helps with equipment selection and technical communication.

**Q: Is the hp to W conversion accurate?**
A: The conversion coefficient is a precise physical constant. Theoretical conversion: 1 hp = 745.7 W, but practical applications need to consider equipment efficiency.

**Q: What are the characteristics of hp as a power unit?**
A: Horsepower is a traditional power unit, mainly used in automotive and mechanical industries, suitable for describing engine and motor power.

**Q: How to use this conversion in motor selection?**
A: Motor nameplate power (hp) can be converted to electrical power (W), but actual power consumption also depends on load conditions and motor efficiency.

**Q: What special requirements do automotive engines have for power conversion?**
A: Automotive engines need to consider power output under different operating conditions. It's recommended to use maximum power for conversion and consider actual operating efficiency.

**Q: What should be noted in international project applications?**
A: International projects should consider different regional standards, recommend using W/kW as the primary unit and providing hp conversion values, ensuring technical documentation clarity.

**Q: Is conversion through kW intermediate more accurate?**
A: Yes, using kW as intermediate conversion (hp→kW→W) can reduce cumulative errors and is suitable for high-precision engineering calculations.
