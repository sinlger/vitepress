**Q: How many watts in one megawatt?**
A: 1 megawatt = 1,000,000 watts = 1 million watts.

**Q: How to calculate power?**
A: Power = energy ÷ time, or power = voltage × current (for electrical power). Basic formula: P = W/t, where P is power, W is work, t is time.

**Q: Difference between active power and reactive power?**
A: Active power is actually consumed power used for work; reactive power flows back and forth in inductive and capacitive elements, does no work but occupies grid capacity.

### Special Unit Questions

**Q: What is db unit?**
A: dB (decibel) is a logarithmic unit for power ratios, commonly using dBm to express absolute power values. 0dBm = 1 milliwatt.
