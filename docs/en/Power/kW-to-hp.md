## Conversion Formula

The conversion between kilowatt (kW) and imperial horsepower (hp) is based on the relationship between metric and imperial power units:

**Basic Formula:**
- 1 kW = 1.34102 hp
- 1 hp = 0.7457 kW

**Conversion Formulas:**
- kW to hp: hp = kW ร 1.34102
- hp to kW: kW = hp รท 1.34102

**Conversion Reference Table:**
| Kilowatt (kW) | Imperial Horsepower (hp) | Application |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 50 kW | 67.05 hp | Small Car Engine |
| 100 kW | 134.10 hp | Mid-size Car Engine |
| 150 kW | 201.15 hp | Large Car Engine |
| 200 kW | 268.20 hp | Performance Car Engine |
| 300 kW | 402.31 hp | High-Performance Engine |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between hp and PS?**
A: hp (imperial horsepower) = 745.7W, while PS (metric horsepower) = 735.5W. hp is slightly larger than PS and is commonly used in the United States.

**Q: Why is hp used in the American automotive industry?**
A: hp is the traditional American standard for automotive power rating, deeply embedded in American automotive culture and consumer understanding.

**Q: When should I use kW vs hp?**
A: Use kW for technical and engineering calculations, hp for consumer-facing specifications in American markets, especially automotive applications.

**Q: How accurate is the conversion?**
A: The conversion factor 1 hp = 745.7W is exact by definition, making conversions mathematically precise.

**Q: Which unit is better for international trade?**
A: kW is preferred for international technical specifications as it's part of the SI system, but hp may be needed for American market documentation.
