## II. Detailed mph and knot Conversion Formula

### How to Convert Miles per Hour and Knots?

**Basic Conversion Formulas:**
- **mph to knot:** knot = mph × 0.868976
- **knot to mph:** mph = knot × 1.150779

**Formula Derivation Process:**
1. 1 nautical mile = 1852 meters (international nautical mile standard)
2. 1 mile = 1609.344 meters (international mile standard)
3. 1 knot = 1 nautical mile/hour = 1852 m/h
4. 1 mph = 1609.344 m/h
5. 1 mph = 1609.344 ÷ 1852 ≈ 0.868976 knot

### How Many Knots Equals One Mile per Hour?

**Precise Answer:** 1 mph = 0.868976 knot

**Common Speed Conversion Examples:**
- 10 mph ≈ 8.69 knot (slow sailing)
- 25 mph ≈ 21.72 knot (speedboat speed)
- 60 mph ≈ 52.14 knot (high-speed vessels)
- 100 mph ≈ 86.90 knot (racing boat speed)

### Quick Mental Calculation Tips

**mph to knot Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate calculation:** mph × 0.87 ≈ knot (error about 0.1%)
2. **Simple trick:** mph - mph × 0.13 ≈ knot
3. **Memory point:** 100 mph ≈ 87 knot

**knot to mph Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate calculation:** knot × 1.15 ≈ mph (error about 0.1%)
2. **Precise calculation:** knot × 1.150779 = mph

## III. Speed Unit Science: From Maritime to Aviation

### Why Do We Need the Knot Unit?

The special requirements of maritime and aviation fields gave birth to the knot unit:

- **knot:** Specialized unit for maritime and aviation, based on nautical miles, convenient for chart and navigation calculations.
- **mph (miles per hour):** Traditional unit in US and UK, commonly used for land transportation.
- **km/h (kilometers per hour):** International universal unit, easy for daily understanding.

### Problems That Unit Confusion May Cause

Case: If a ship speed of 20 knots is miscalculated as 20 mph (actually ≈23 mph), it will lead to arrival time calculation errors in maritime navigation, affecting sailing safety.

Scientific recommendation: Maritime and aviation professionals must be familiar with knot and mph conversion to avoid navigation calculation errors.

### Historical Comparison of Nautical Miles and Miles

- **Nautical mile origin:** Based on Earth's meridian, 1 nautical mile = 1/21600 of Earth's meridian
- **Mile origin:** Ancient Roman "mille passus" (thousand paces)
- **Modern standards:** 1 nautical mile = 1852 meters, 1 mile = 1609.344 meters
- **Application scope:** Nautical miles for maritime and aviation, miles for land transportation

### Fun Facts: Speed Limits and Daily Life

- Commercial aircraft cruising: approximately 450-500 knots = 518-575 mph
- Military fighter jets: supersonic can reach 1000+ knots = 1150+ mph
- Large cargo ships: economic speed approximately 15-20 knots = 17-23 mph
- Sailing competitions: fastest can reach 40+ knots = 46+ mph
