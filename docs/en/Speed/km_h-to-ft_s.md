## II. Detailed Explanation of km/h and ft/s Conversion Formulas

### How to Convert Between Kilometers per Hour and Feet per Second?

**Basic Conversion Formulas:**
- **km/h to ft/s:** ft/s = km/h × 0.911344
- **ft/s to km/h:** km/h = ft/s × 1.09728

**Formula Derivation Process:**
1. 1 kilometer = 3280.84 feet (1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 3.28084 ft)
2. 1 hour = 3600 seconds
3. 1 km/h = 3280.84 ft ÷ 3600 s ≈ 0.911344 ft/s

### How Many Feet per Second in One Kilometer per Hour?

**Precise Answer:** 1 km/h = 0.911344 ft/s

**Common Speed Conversion Examples:**
- 36 km/h ≈ 32.8 ft/s (about 10 m/s)
- 72 km/h ≈ 65.6 ft/s (about 20 m/s)
- 108 km/h ≈ 98.4 ft/s (about 30 m/s)
- 144 km/h ≈ 131.2 ft/s (about 40 m/s)

### Quick Mental Calculation Tips

**km/h to ft/s Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate Calculation:** km/h × 0.9 ≈ ft/s (error about 1%)
2. **Simple Trick:** km/h ÷ 1.1 ≈ ft/s
3. **Memory Point:** 36 km/h ≈ 33 ft/s

**ft/s to km/h Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate Calculation:** ft/s × 1.1 ≈ km/h (error about 1%)
2. **Precise Calculation:** ft/s × 1.09728 = km/h

## III. Speed Units Explained: From Daily Use to Professional Applications

### Why Do We Need Multiple Speed Units?

Different historical developments and practical needs across various fields have led to diverse units:

- **ft/s (feet per second)**: Commonly used in US engineering, especially in fluid dynamics, construction engineering, and mechanical design. Convenient for use with imperial length units.
- **km/h (kilometers per hour)**: Internationally used unit, easy to understand for daily use and land transportation applications.

### Unit Confusion Can Cause Problems

Case study: If a fluid velocity of 10 ft/s is mistakenly calculated as 10 km/h (actually ≈10.97 km/h), it will lead to flow calculation errors in engineering.

Scientific recommendation: US engineering projects must be familiar with imperial unit conversions to avoid design parameter errors.
