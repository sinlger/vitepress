## II. Detailed mph and m/s Conversion Formulas

### How to Convert Miles per Hour and Meters per Second?

**Basic Conversion Formulas:**
- **mph to m/s:** m/s = mph × 0.44704
- **m/s to mph:** mph = m/s × 2.23694

**Formula Derivation Process:**
1. 1 mile = 1609.344 meters (international mile standard)
2. 1 hour = 3600 seconds
3. 1 mph = 1609.344 m ÷ 3600 s = 0.44704 m/s

### How Many Meters per Second Equals One Mile per Hour?

**Precise Answer:** 1 mph = 0.44704 m/s

**Common Speed Conversion Examples:**
- 10 mph ≈ 4.47 m/s (walking speed)
- 25 mph ≈ 11.18 m/s (city speed limit)
- 60 mph ≈ 26.82 m/s (highway speed)
- 100 mph ≈ 44.70 m/s (high-speed driving)

### Quick Mental Calculation Tips

**mph to m/s Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate calculation:** mph × 0.45 ≈ m/s (error about 0.5%)
2. **Simple trick:** mph ÷ 2.2 ≈ m/s
3. **Memory point:** 60 mph ≈ 27 m/s

**m/s to mph Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate calculation:** m/s × 2.2 ≈ mph (error about 2%)
2. **Precise calculation:** m/s × 2.23694 = mph

## III. Speed Unit Science: From Daily Life to Professional Applications

### Why Do We Need Multiple Speed Units?

Different fields' historical evolution and practical needs have created diverse units:

- **mph (miles per hour)**: Traditional unit in English-speaking countries, especially in transportation and aviation. Convenient for use with imperial distance units.
- **m/s (meters per second)**: International standard unit, preferred for scientific calculations and engineering applications.
- **km/h (kilometers per hour)**: Internationally common unit, convenient for daily understanding and land transportation applications.

### Problems That Unit Confusion Can Cause

Case study: If a vehicle speed of 60 mph is mistakenly calculated as 60 km/h (actually ≈96.6 km/h), it would result in serious speeding during international driving, causing safety issues.

Scientific recommendation: International travel and trade must be familiar with mph and km/h conversions to avoid speed understanding errors.

### History and Applications of Miles

- **Mile origin**: Ancient Roman "mille passus" (thousand paces), modernly standardized as 5280 feet
- **Modern mile**: 1 mile = 1609.344 meters = 1.609344 kilometers (precise value)
- **Application scope**: Transportation, aviation, sports and other fields in countries like the US and UK

### Fun Facts: Speed Limits and Daily Life

- Highway speed limits: Usually 70-80 mph ≈ 31-36 m/s in the US
- Baseball pitch speed: Fastest about 100 mph ≈ 44.7 m/s
- Commercial aircraft cruise: About 500-600 mph ≈ 223-268 m/s
