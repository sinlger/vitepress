## II. Detailed Conversion Formula for mph and ft/s

### How to Convert Between Miles per Hour and Feet per Second?

**Basic Conversion Formulas:**
- **mph to ft/s:** ft/s = mph × 1.466667
- **ft/s to mph:** mph = ft/s × 0.681818

**Formula Derivation Process:**
1. 1 mile = 5280 feet (imperial length standard)
2. 1 hour = 3600 seconds (time standard)
3. 1 mph = 5280 feet/3600 seconds = 1.466667 ft/s
4. Exact value: 1 mph = 22/15 ft/s = 1.4̄6̄ ft/s

### How Many Feet per Second Equal One Mile per Hour?

**Precise Answer:** 1 mph = 1.466667 ft/s (or 22/15 ft/s)

**Common Speed Conversion Examples:**
- 10 mph ≈ 14.67 ft/s (slow driving)
- 30 mph ≈ 44.00 ft/s (city speed limit)
- 60 mph ≈ 88.00 ft/s (highway)
- 100 mph ≈ 146.67 ft/s (high speed)

### Quick Mental Calculation Tips

**mph to ft/s Mental Calculation:**
1. **Precise calculation:** mph × 1.467 ≈ ft/s (error <0.1%)
2. **Simple trick:** mph + mph × 0.47 ≈ ft/s
3. **Memory points:** 60 mph = 88 ft/s, 30 mph = 44 ft/s

**ft/s to mph Mental Calculation:**
1. **Approximate calculation:** ft/s × 0.68 ≈ mph (error ~0.2%)
2. **Precise calculation:** ft/s × 0.681818 = mph
3. **Memory trick:** ft/s × 2/3 ≈ mph (rough estimate)

## III. Scientific Knowledge: From Imperial Tradition to Modern Engineering

### Why Does the US Engineering Field Use ft/s?

Importance of ft/s in US engineering and scientific calculations:

- **ft/s (feet per second)**: US engineering standard unit, convenient for imperial system calculations.
- **mph (miles per hour)**: Common unit for daily transportation and aviation.
- **m/s (meters per second)**: International scientific standard, preferred in physics.

### Potential Issues with Unit Confusion

Case study: If fluid velocity of 30 ft/s is mistakenly calculated as 30 mph (actually ≈20.5 mph), it would lead to flow calculation errors in engineering design, affecting system performance and safety.

Engineering recommendation: US engineers must be familiar with ft/s and mph conversions to ensure design calculation accuracy.

### Historical Origins of Feet and Miles

- **Foot origin**: Ancient human body scale, 1 foot ≈ adult male foot length
- **Mile origin**: Ancient Roman "mille passus" (thousand paces), approximately 1609 meters
- **Modern standards**: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters, 1 mile = 1609.344 meters
- **Application scope**: Feet used in construction engineering, miles used for transportation distances

### Fun Facts: Engineering Applications of Speed

- Pipe flow velocity: typically 2-10 ft/s, avoiding erosion and noise
- Wind tunnel testing: can reach hundreds of ft/s, testing aerodynamics
- Jet engines: exhaust velocity can reach 1000+ ft/s
- Free fall: gravitational acceleration 32.2 ft/s², terminal velocity approximately 120 mph = 176 ft/s
