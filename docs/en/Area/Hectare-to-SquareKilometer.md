The conversion formula is:
- Square kilometers = Hectares × 0.01
- Hectares = Square kilometers × 100

## Conversion Guide

### What is a Hectare?
A hectare is a metric unit of area measurement, primarily used for measuring land areas. One hectare equals 10,000 square meters or 2.471 acres. It's commonly used in agriculture, forestry, and land planning.

### What is a Square Kilometer?
A square kilometer is a metric unit of area measurement, equal to a square with sides of one kilometer each. It's used for measuring large areas such as cities, countries, forests, and other geographical regions.

### Conversion Steps
1. Identify the hectare value you want to convert
2. Multiply the hectare value by 0.01 (or divide by 100)
3. The result is the equivalent area in square kilometers

## Practical Application Examples

### Example 1: Agricultural Planning
A large farm covering 500 hectares:
- 500 hectares × 0.01 = 5 square kilometers
- This helps in regional agricultural planning and land management

### Example 2: Forest Management
A protected forest area of 2,500 hectares:
- 2,500 hectares × 0.01 = 25 square kilometers
- Useful for environmental conservation and forest management planning

### Example 3: Urban Development
A city development project spanning 1,200 hectares:
- 1,200 hectares × 0.01 = 12 square kilometers
- Important for urban planning and infrastructure development
