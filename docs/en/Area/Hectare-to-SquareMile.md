## Conversion Guide

### What is a Hectare?
A hectare is a metric unit of area measurement, primarily used for measuring land areas. One hectare equals 10,000 square meters or 2.471 acres. It's commonly used in agriculture, forestry, and land planning worldwide.

### What is a Square Mile?
A square mile is an imperial unit of area measurement, equal to a square with sides of one mile each. It's commonly used for measuring large areas such as cities, counties, states, and geographical regions, particularly in the United States.
