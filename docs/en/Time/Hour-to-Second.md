## Formula

The formula for converting from **Hours (h)** to **Seconds (s)** is:
$$ s = h \times 3600 $$

### Examples
- 1h = 3600s
- 5h = 18000s
- 0.1h = 360s

## Practical Application Scenarios

### Scientific Experiments
In physics and chemistry experiments, it's necessary to convert experiment duration from hours to seconds for precise recording of experimental processes and data analysis.

### Engineering Calculations
In engineering design and construction, it's necessary to convert work time from hours to seconds for precise time control and progress management.

### Sports Timing
In sports competitions and training, it's necessary to convert training time from hours to seconds for creating detailed training plans and performance statistics.

### Programming Development
In software development, it's necessary to convert time intervals from hours to seconds for timer settings, performance testing, and system monitoring.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is the conversion formula from hours to seconds?
The conversion formula from hours to seconds is: seconds = hours × 3600. This is because 1 hour = 60 minutes, and 1 minute = 60 seconds.

### 2. Why does 1 hour equal 3600 seconds?
Because 1 hour = 60 minutes, and 1 minute = 60 seconds, so 1 hour = 60 × 60 = 3600 seconds.

### 3. How to quickly perform mental calculations for conversion?
Remember the basic relationships: 1 hour = 3600 seconds, 0.5 hours = 1800 seconds, 0.25 hours = 900 seconds, then perform the corresponding multiplication.

### 4. How to apply this conversion in programming?
In programming, it's often necessary to convert user-input hours to seconds for use in time-related functions like setTimeout and setInterval.

### 5. How to convert decimal hours to seconds?
Multiply the decimal hours by 3600. For example: 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 3600 = 9000 seconds.

### 6. How to verify the accuracy of conversion results?
You can use reverse calculation for verification: divide the obtained seconds by 3600, which should equal the original number of hours.
