## Formula

The formula for converting from **seconds (s)** to **minutes (min)** is:
$$ min = s \div 60 $$

### Examples
- 60s = 1min
- 120s = 2min
- 30s = 0.5min

- **Data Processing Time Tracking**: Monitoring data processing durations in minute format

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How many seconds are in one minute?**
A: 1 minute = 60 seconds. This is the standard international time unit conversion relationship.

**Q: How to convert seconds to minutes accurately?**
A: Divide the number of seconds by 60. For example, 120 seconds รท 60 = 2 minutes.

**Q: When would second to minute conversion be commonly used?**
A: Commonly used in time management, sports timing, work efficiency analysis, educational time tracking, and system performance monitoring.

**Q: What's the difference between seconds and minutes in practical applications?**
A: Seconds are used for precise, short-duration measurements, while minutes are more suitable for general time management and longer duration tracking.
