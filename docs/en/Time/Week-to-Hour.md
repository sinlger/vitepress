# Week (week) to Hour (h) Conversion

Week to hour conversion is a common time calculation requirement in daily life and work. Whether for work hour statistics in project management, detailed work plan arrangements, or precise study time planning, mastering the week to hour conversion method is very important. One week equals 168 hours, and this conversion relationship is particularly useful when creating detailed time plans.

<script setup>
import { onMounted, reactive, inject, ref } from 'vue'
import { NButton,NForm ,NFormItem,NInput,NInputNumber,NSelect,NCard,useMessage,NGrid ,NGi  } from 'naive-ui'
import { defineClientComponent } from 'vitepress'
import { Time } from '../files';

const convert = inject('convert')
const seoKey = ['week unit conversion','week conversion','what is week unit','hour unit','week conversion','time week','week to hour conversion','time transformation','one week','week definition','week unit','week conversion','how many hours in a week','hour time calculation','week in English','time week','time unit','time conversion','hour unit','one week equals how many hours','168 hours']
const form = reactive({
  number: null,
  result: '',
  title: 'Week to Hour Converter'
})

const convertHandler = () => {
  if (form.number !== null && !isNaN(form.number)) {
    const convertedValue = parseFloat(form.number) * 168
    form.result = `${form.number}week = ${convertedValue.toFixed(2)}h`
  } else {
    form.result = 'Please enter a valid number.'
  }
}
</script>

<n-card :title="form.title" size="small" :bordered="false" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
  <n-form size="large" :model="form">
    <n-form-item label="Week (week)">
