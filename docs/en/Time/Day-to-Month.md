## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What is the conversion formula from days to months?
A: The basic formula is: months = days ÷ 30. However, note that this is an approximate conversion, as actual months vary between 28-31 days.

### Q: Why use 30 days as one month?
A: 30 days is an approximate value for average month length. In practical applications, you can choose 30 days, 30.44 days (annual average), or specific month days based on requirements.

### Q: How to handle days less than one month?
A: You can use decimals, such as 45 days = 1.5 months, or express separately as 1 month and 15 days.

### Q: Does leap year affect day to month conversion?
A: Yes, slightly. Leap years average about 30.5 days per month, while regular years average about 30.4 days. Precise calculations need to consider the specific year.

### Q: How to accurately convert in project management?
A: It's recommended to use specific start and end dates for calculation, or choose appropriate month length standards (such as 30 days, 30.44 days, etc.) based on project characteristics.

### Q: What should be noted in contract term conversion?
A: Contracts should clearly define the definition of a month (calendar month or 30 days) to avoid disputes due to different conversion standards.
