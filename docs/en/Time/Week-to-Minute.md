Week to minute conversion is very practical in daily life and work planning. Minutes, as a commonly used time unit, are convenient for creating detailed time arrangements and precise plan management. One week equals 10,080 minutes, and this conversion relationship has important applications in project management, study planning, and work arrangements.

    const convertedValue = parseFloat(form.number) * 10080
    form.result = `${form.number}week = ${convertedValue.toFixed(2)}min`
  } else {
    form.result = 'Please enter a valid number.'
