## Formula

The formula for converting from **year** to **day** is:
$$ d = year \times 365 $$

### Examples
- 1 year = 365 days
- 2 years = 730 days
- 0.5 year = 182.5 days

## Practical Application Scenarios

### Project Management
In project management, year to day conversion helps project managers develop detailed project plans. For example, a 2-year project contains 730 days, making it easy to break down into specific milestones and task nodes.

### Study Planning
When developing long-term study plans, converting annual goals to days helps with better time allocation. For instance, a 1-year study plan can be broken down into 365 days of specific learning tasks.

### Schedule Planning
In personal or corporate annual planning, converting annual goals to days helps develop more specific execution plans. For example, annual sales targets can be broken down into specific daily indicators.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why use 365 days instead of 365.25 days?**
