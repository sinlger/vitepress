## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: What is the conversion relationship between minutes and weeks?
A1: 1 week = 10,080 minutes. This conversion is based on the time relationship: 1 week = 7 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes = 10,080 minutes.

### Q2: Why is the conversion factor 10,080?
A2: This factor comes from the hierarchical relationship of time units: 1 week = 7 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes = 10,080 minutes.

A4: It's mainly used in scenarios requiring periodic time management such as work time statistics, project progress planning, learning plan development, and equipment maintenance cycles.

### Q5: How to perform minute to week calculations in project management?
A5: You can use division: weeks = minutes ÷ 10,080. This way, accumulated work minutes can be converted to weeks.

### Q6: Is there a difference between work weeks and natural weeks in conversion?
A6: This conversion is based on natural weeks (7 days). If it's a work week (usually 5 days), the conversion factor needs to be adjusted according to the actual working days.
