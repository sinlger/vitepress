## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What is the conversion formula from days to weeks?
A: The formula is: weeks = days ÷ 7. That is, 7 days = 1 week.

### Q: Why is one week 7 days?
A: The 7-day week system originated from ancient civilizations and has become the internationally accepted time unit standard.

### Q: How to handle days less than one week?
A: You can use decimals, such as 10 days = 1.43 weeks, or express separately as 1 week and 3 days.

### Q: Is there a difference between working days and calendar days in conversion?
A: Usually day to week conversion refers to calendar days. If calculating work weeks, you need to clarify the definition of working days (such as a 5-day work system).

### Q: How to accurately use weeks in project management?
A: It's recommended to combine specific start and end dates, consider holidays and working day arrangements, and create more precise project schedules.

### Q: How to verify conversion results?
A: You can verify through reverse calculation - multiplying the weeks by 7 should equal the original number of days.
