## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What is the conversion formula from days to years?
A: The basic formula is: years = days ÷ 365. However, considering leap years, the more accurate average is 365.25 days/year.

### Q: Why consider leap years?
A: Every 4 years there is a leap year (366 days), so the average is 365.25 days per year. Using this value is more accurate for long-term calculations.

### Q: How to handle days less than one year?
A: You can use decimals, such as 400 days ≈ 1.1 years, or express separately as 1 year and 35 days.

### Q: How to accurately convert in historical research?
A: Historical research needs to consider different calendar systems, such as Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, etc. Special attention is needed during conversion.

### Q: How is a year defined in investment calculations?
A: In financial calculations, usually 365 days or 360 days are used as one year, depending on calculation standards and financial product types.

### Q: How to verify conversion results?
A: You can verify through reverse calculation - multiplying the years by 365 (or 365.25) should be close to the original number of days.
