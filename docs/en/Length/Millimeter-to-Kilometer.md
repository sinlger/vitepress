# Millimeter (mm) to Kilometer (km) Conversion

The conversion from millimeters to kilometers serves as an important bridge connecting microscopic precision measurement with macroscopic distance calculation. In modern engineering technology, scientific research, and industrial manufacturing, accurate conversion between extremely small precision dimensions (millimeter level) and large-scale distances (kilometer level) is frequently required. This conversion is of great significance in aerospace engineering, precision manufacturing, geographic surveying, construction engineering, and other fields, ensuring accuracy and consistency from microscopic component design to macroscopic engineering planning.

## Formulas

### Millimeter to Kilometer Conversion Formula
The formula for converting from **millimeters (mm)** to **kilometers (km)** is:
$$ km = mm \div 1000000 $$
Or:
$$ km = mm \times 0.000001 $$

### Kilometer to Millimeter Conversion Formula
The formula for converting from **kilometers (km)** to **millimeters (mm)** is:
$$ mm = km \times 1000000 $$

### Conversion Examples
- 1mm = 0.000001km
- 1000mm = 0.001km
- 100000mm = 0.1km
- 500000mm = 0.5km
- 1000000mm = 1.0km (Standard conversion)
