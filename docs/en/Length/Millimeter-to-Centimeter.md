# Millimeter (mm) to Centimeter (cm) Conversion

Millimeter to centimeter conversion is one of the most commonly used length unit conversions in daily life and professional work. Millimeter (mm), as one of the fundamental units of the metric length system, is widely used in precision measurement, engineering manufacturing, and scientific research, while centimeter (cm) is a more intuitive medium-length unit. Mastering the accurate conversion relationship between millimeters and centimeters has important practical value for engineering design, construction, education and teaching, and daily measurement.

## Formulas

### Millimeter to Centimeter Conversion Formula
The formula for converting from **millimeters (mm)** to **centimeters (cm)** is:
$$ cm = mm \div 10 $$
Or:
$$ cm = mm \times 0.1 $$

### Centimeter to Millimeter Conversion Formula
The formula for converting from **centimeters (cm)** to **millimeters (mm)** is:
$$ mm = cm \times 10 $$

### Conversion Examples
- 1mm = 0.1cm
- 5mm = 0.5cm
- 10mm = 1.0cm
- 25mm = 2.5cm
- 50mm = 5.0cm
- 100mm = 10.0cm

### Length Unit Conversion Table
| Millimeters (mm) | Centimeters (cm) | Decimeters (dm) | Meters (m) | Inches (in) |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0.1 | 0.01 | 0.001 | 0.0394 |
| 10 | 1 | 0.1 | 0.01 | 0.394 |
| 25 | 2.5 | 0.25 | 0.025 | 0.984 |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is the difference between millimeters and centimeters?
Millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm) are both metric length units, with 1 centimeter equal to 10 millimeters. Millimeters are more suitable for precision measurement, while centimeters are more suitable for daily measurement.

### 2. How to quickly convert millimeters to centimeters?
The simplest method is to divide the millimeter number by 10, or add a decimal point after the millimeter number and move it one place to the left. For example: 25mm = 2.5cm.

### 3. When to use millimeters and when to use centimeters?
Millimeters are typically used for precision measurement, engineering drawings, medical devices and other situations requiring high accuracy; centimeters are mostly used for daily measurement, education and teaching, household items and similar situations.

### 4. Is there any error in millimeter to centimeter conversion?
Millimeter to centimeter conversion is a precise mathematical relationship with no error. 1 millimeter always equals 0.1 centimeter.

### 5. How to correctly mark millimeters and centimeters in engineering drawings?
Engineering drawings typically use millimeters uniformly as the marking unit to avoid confusion caused by mixing different units. If centimeters need to be used, unit symbols should be clearly marked.

### 6. In which industries is millimeter-centimeter conversion most important?
It is widely applied mainly in industries requiring precise measurement such as mechanical manufacturing, construction engineering, electronic manufacturing, medical devices, education and research.
