## Common Conversion Formulas

### Centimeter to Meter Conversion
- **1 centimeter = 0.01 meters**
- **1 meter = 100 centimeters**

### Other Common Length Unit Conversions
- **Centimeter to Millimeter**: 1cm = 10mm
- **Centimeter to Kilometer**: 1cm = 0.00001km
- **Meter to Kilometer**: 1m = 0.001km
- **Meter to Millimeter**: 1m = 1000mm
- **Meter to Foot**: 1m = 3.28084ft

## Length Unit Conversion Table

| Centimeter(cm) | Meter(m) | Millimeter(mm) | Kilometer(km) | Foot(ft) |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 0.01 | 10 | 0.00001 | 0.032808 |
| 10 | 0.1 | 100 | 0.0001 | 0.32808 |
| 50 | 0.5 | 500 | 0.0005 | 1.6404 |
| 100 | 1 | 1,000 | 0.001 | 3.2808 |
| 200 | 2 | 2,000 | 0.002 | 6.5617 |

## Practical Applications

Centimeters (cm) and meters (m) are the most commonly used units for measuring everyday object dimensions, and are very important in the following real-world scenarios:

- **Construction and Renovation**:
  - Room dimensions are usually measured in meters, but detailed decoration (such as tiles, baseboards) are marked in centimeters.
  - Example: A room is 5m long, with a baseboard height of 10cm.

- **Fashion Design**:
  - Human height is expressed in meters, but clothing detail dimensions (such as sleeve length, collar circumference) are measured in centimeters.
  - Example: A person is 1.75m tall, with a shirt sleeve length of 65cm.

- **Furniture Manufacturing**:
  - Overall furniture dimensions are marked in meters, but component thickness and gaps are expressed in centimeters.
  - Example: A desk is 1.2m long, with a desktop thickness of 3cm.

- **Sports**:
  - Sports venue lengths are measured in meters, but equipment specifications are marked in centimeters.
  - Example: A basketball court is 28m long, with a basketball diameter of approximately 24cm.

## Formula

The formula for converting from **centimeters (cm)** to **meters (m)** is:
$$ m = cm \div 100 $$

### Examples
- 100cm = 1.00m
- 50cm = 0.50m
- 10cm = 0.10m

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is a meter unit?
A meter (m) is the basic unit of length in the International System of Units, where 1 meter equals 100 centimeters. It is the most widely used length unit in the world, used for measuring room dimensions, human height, object lengths, etc.

### 2. What is the conversion formula between centimeters and meters?
The conversion formula from centimeters to meters is: meters = centimeters ÷ 100
The conversion formula from meters to centimeters is: centimeters = meters × 100

### 3. When is the meter unit used?
Meters are mainly used for measuring medium-length objects, such as room dimensions, human height, furniture dimensions, sports venues, etc. They are widely used in construction, engineering, and daily life.

### 4. How to quickly estimate centimeter to meter conversion?
You can remember: 100 centimeters equals 1 meter. Therefore, dividing centimeters by 100 gives you meters. For example: 150cm = 1.5m, 250cm = 2.5m.

### 5. What are common meter and centimeter correspondences?
- 1 meter = 100 centimeters
- 1 centimeter = 0.01 meters
- 1 millimeter = 0.1 centimeters = 0.001 meters
- 1 kilometer = 100,000 centimeters = 1000 meters
