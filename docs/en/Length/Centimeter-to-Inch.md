## Length Unit Conversion Table

| Centimeter(cm) | Inch(in) | Meter(m) | Foot(ft) | Millimeter(mm) |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 0.39370 | 0.01 | 0.032808 | 10 |
| 2.54 | 1.00000 | 0.0254 | 0.083333 | 25.4 |
| 5 | 1.96850 | 0.05 | 0.164042 | 50 |
| 10 | 3.93701 | 0.1 | 0.328084 | 100 |
| 30.48 | 12.0000 | 0.3048 | 1.000000 | 304.8 |

## Practical Applications

Centimeters (cm) and inches (in) are commonly used units for measuring everyday object dimensions, and are very important in the following real-world scenarios:

- **Manufacturing**:
  - In precision parts processing, drawings often use centimeters for detailed dimensions, while export products may need to be expressed in inches.
  - Example: A mechanical part thickness of 5cm equals 1.9685in.

- **Electronics**:
  - Screen sizes of mobile phones, tablets and other electronic devices are usually measured in inches, but internal component dimensions use centimeters.
  - Example: A phone screen size of 6.5in (i.e., 16.51cm), but its camera module thickness is 0.8cm.

- **Construction and Engineering**:
  - Construction drawings often use centimeters for detailed dimensions, but may need to be converted to inches for international projects.
  - Example: A building wall thickness of 20cm equals 7.874in.

- **Education and Experiments**:
  - Students use centimeter rulers for measurements in laboratories, but reports may need to be expressed in inches.
  - Example: A student measures a book thickness of 3cm, which equals 1.1811in.

## Formula

The formula for converting from **centimeters (cm)** to **inches (in)** is:
$$ in = cm \times 0.3937 $$

### Examples
- 10cm = 3.9370in
- 50cm = 19.6850in
- 100cm = 39.3700in

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is an inch unit?
An inch (in) is an imperial length unit, where 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters. It is widely used for measuring electronic device screen sizes, pipe diameters, screw specifications, etc.

### 2. What is the conversion formula between centimeters and inches?
The conversion formula from centimeters to inches is: inches = centimeters × 0.393701
The conversion formula from inches to centimeters is: centimeters = inches × 2.54

### 3. When is the inch unit used?
Inches are mainly used for electronic device screen sizes (such as phones, TVs), industrial pipes, screw and bolt specifications, tire sizes, etc. Inches are also commonly used in daily life in the United States and United Kingdom.

### 4. How to quickly estimate centimeter to inch conversion?
You can remember: approximately 2.5 centimeters equals 1 inch. Therefore, dividing centimeters by 2.5 gives you an approximate number of inches.

### 5. What are common inch and centimeter correspondences?
- 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
- 1 centimeter ≈ 0.4 inches
- 12 inches = 1 foot = 30.48 centimeters
- 1 millimeter ≈ 0.04 inches
