# Millimeter (mm) to Foot (ft) Conversion

Millimeter to foot conversion is an important transformation connecting metric precision measurement with international imperial standards. Millimeter (mm), as an international standard metric length unit, is widely used in precision manufacturing, engineering design, and scientific research, while foot (ft) is an internationally used imperial length unit, widely used in construction engineering, sports, daily life, and other fields. Mastering the accurate conversion relationship between millimeters and feet has important practical significance for international engineering cooperation, product export, architectural design, and manufacturing.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How is the conversion accuracy between millimeters and feet ensured?
The conversion factor from millimeters to feet is 0.00328084, which is based on international standard definitions. In engineering applications, retaining 5-6 decimal places typically meets precision requirements.

### 2. What is the difference between international feet and US survey feet?
International foot (ft) = 304.8 millimeters, while US survey foot (ft-us) = 304.8006096 millimeters. Although the difference is minimal, this discrepancy can accumulate into significant errors in large engineering projects.

### 3. How is this conversion applied in construction engineering?
In construction engineering, precise millimeter to foot conversion ensures dimensional consistency in international projects. For example, door and window dimensions, structural beam and column specifications all require accurate conversion.

### 4. What are the conversion considerations in sports venue construction?
Sports venues require strict adherence to international standards, and conversions should consider the specific requirements of different sports. It is recommended to use high-precision conversion factors and perform multiple verifications.

### 5. How to set correct units in design software?
Mainstream design software supports automatic conversion between millimeters and feet. It is recommended to determine the primary unit system at the project start to avoid precision loss from later conversions.

### 6. What are the conversion standards for furniture export?
Furniture export typically requires conversion accuracy of ±0.001ft or ±0.3mm. For high-end furniture, higher conversion precision may be needed to ensure product quality.
